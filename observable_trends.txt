1. CNN is the only outlet with an overall negative sentiment.  Potentially due it being a left-leaning outlet while there is currently a Republican president.
2. Keeping in mind number one, Fox is on the positive side.  As it is a right-leaning outlet, I would, again, apply the Republican president rule.
3. The New York Times does not have a channel on television like CNN or Fox and is very balanced regarding tweet polarity.
